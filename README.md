## üìù Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **student exam scores** based on various **socioeconomic and parental factors**. The goal is to gain insights into how attributes like **parent education**, **weekly study hours**, and **marital status** impact a student's performance in **Math, Reading,** and **Writing** exams.

The dataset features include:
- **Gender**
- **Ethnic Group**
- **Parent's Education Level**
- **Lunch Type** (Standard / Free/Reduced)
- **Test Preparation** (Completed / None)
- **Marital Status**
- **Practice Sport**
- **Number of Siblings**
- **Transport Means** (School Bus / Private)
- **Weekly Study Hours**
- **Math, Reading, and Writing Scores**

## üîç Key Insights from the Analysis
In this project, we explored multiple relationships using **data visualizations** and descriptive statistics:
- How **parental education** impacts student scores in different subjects.
- The effect of **test preparation** on exam results.
- **Weekly study hours** and their correlation with exam performance.
- **Heat maps** to detect relationships between:
  - Students practicing sports or not, and their exam scores.
  - The number of siblings a student has and their scores.
  - Ethnic groups and their scores.

## üìà Visualizations
The project features a variety of visualizations to help understand trends in the dataset:
- **Bar plots**: Compare student performance based on parental education level and other factors.
- **Box plots**: Detect outliers in exam scores and visualize score distributions across various categories.
- **Pie charts**: Visualize the distribution of students across **ethnic groups**, **lunch types**, and **marital statuses**.
- **Heat maps**: Show relationships between:
  - Whether a student practices sports and their exam scores.
  - The number of siblings and their scores.
  - Ethnic groups and their scores.
- **Scatter plots**: Show the relationship between weekly study hours and exam scores.
- **Line charts**: Track the effect of test preparation over time on performance across subjects.

These visualizations provide valuable insights into the factors affecting students' academic achievements.

## üí° Future Scope: Machine Learning
To enhance this analysis, future work could involve applying **machine learning** techniques to predict student scores based on socioeconomic and parental factors. This model could help schools and educators proactively identify students who may need additional support and resources.

Potential areas for machine learning integration include:
- Predicting **Math, Reading,** and **Writing scores** based on parental background.
- Building a model to classify students who are at risk of **low academic performance**.

## üîß Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9**: The programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for creating detailed visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment for running the analysis and visualizations.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemilshah99316/STUDENT_EXAM_SCORE_ANALYSIS_USING_PYTHON.git
   ```
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/hemilshah99316/STUDENT_EXAM_SCORE_ANALYSIS_USING_PYTHON/blob/main/Student%20Result%20Analysis%20.ipynb
      ```
3. **Run the analysis** within the notebook and explore the visualizations.

## üèÜ Conclusion
This analysis reveals the significant impact of socioeconomic and parental factors on student performance. Future steps involve developing a **machine learning model** to predict student marks and identify students needing extra academic support.
